## ü§ø Transparent Diving Helmets:
This mod adds transparency to the glass visors of the diving suits available as of the *"Among the Ancients"* update.

**Features:**
- Ability to see the fear in your crew-mates eyes as you abandon them to their fate in a thresher nest.
- No more games of "*Guess Who*" or "*Who Dunnit*?" as you'll now be able to identify the occupant of the suit.
- Improved and roomier helmets to accommodate the Captain who takes himself seriously, the assistant who values style over function or the child of the Honkmother who wants to wear their colours proudly.

**Diving suits modified as of [01/12/21]:**
- Base Diving Suit
- Combat Diving Suit
- Abyss Diving Suit
- The Slipsuit
- PUCS Diving Suit
